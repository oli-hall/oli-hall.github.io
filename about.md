I’m a software engineer by trade, currently working in data processing (‘Big Data’ etc). I mostly work with Spark, Hadoop et al, often on the cloud.

Aside from all that, I like dogs, music, and partaking in various exercise-y/sports type things. I’m not the best with humans, but am trying to improve :D I spend far too much time getting excited about technology and engineering, and am a particular fan of space and clean tech (though to be honest, if it’s sciencey and involves engineering, chances are I’ll like it).
