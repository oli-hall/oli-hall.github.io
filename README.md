This used to be the home of my GitHub pages site, but I've since migrated to a fully custom site at https://www.oli-hall.com. All of the content that was here is now migrated over, and I now have complete control over how it works (and a shiny custom domain!).

There is a redirect in place (see the `CNAME` file in this repo), so if you go to oli-hall.github.io, you'll be automatically redirected.
