My Github pages site. Mostly planned to be a blog, but may expand to other territory later. Theme is currently a default [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme called [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight), but I may tweak and rearrange things later.

I figured this was easier than hosting my own site, and faffing around with all of that malarky. For better or worse, GitHub is a solid constant, and unlikely to crash, so seems a safe bet for posts and whatnot.
